Once you're done, firstly, congratulations! That is a milestone you should be proud of.
 The next step is to get it published to this site.

If you found the same or similar project and are contributing to an existing Git repo,
 refer to that projects Contribution Guidelines and work with the project Moderators
 to get the right access. You can always fork an existing Neotys-Connect repo, make
 your changes in your copy, then issue a pull request back to the original repo as well.

If this is a new project and you have pushed your changes to a Git repo you own under
 your own Github account, all you would need to do is Transfer Ownership to
 the 'Neotys-Connect' organization.

Once received, the {% include core-team-link.md %} will review it and either provide
 you feedback or accept it and make you a Moderator of your repo once hosted in Neotys-Connect.

Also feel free to reach out to our {% include core-team-link.md %} afterwards.
