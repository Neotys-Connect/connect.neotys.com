Since NeoLoad is Java based and many of the examples use Eclipse IDE, you should be
 familiar with programming in Java. This does not prevent you from using the IDE
 of your choice, but then you will need to adapt the concepts in the official examples
 to that of your own IDE (such as including dependencies, packaging your JAR file, etc.)

You will need:

- Java programming experience
- A Java IDE (examples use Eclipse w/ Maven)
- NeoLoad Desktop (GUI) installed and licensed
