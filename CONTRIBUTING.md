# Contributing to connect.neotys.com

This document contains the technical details on how to set up Jekyll (to see your edits locally before pushing them to GitHub), and how to prepare a pull request to make changes to content on the [connect.neotys.com](https://connect.neotys.com) website.

# General Process

- [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
- [create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) in your fork repo before you start working
- make changes and then [test them locally with Jekyll serve](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [push them](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) back to your fork branch
- [create a new Github Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for your fork branch to the [connect repo main](https://github.com/Neotys-Connect/connect.neotys.com/tree/main)

# Pull Request Approvals

The Connect Core Team does it's best to respect the value of your work by reviewing
 and approving as quickly as humanly possible, however to make sure nefarious or plain broken
 contributions aren't automatically published to the site, we do manually review
 each pull request. Once it is approved, you will be notified by Github and if
 you've reached out to the Connect Core Team, we will reply to you directly as well.
