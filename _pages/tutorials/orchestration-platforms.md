You can run NeoLoad load tests in many different CI/orchestration platforms using
 the NeoLoad CLI which isn't a plugin, but rather a DevOps command-line tool for
 executing tests in NeoLoad Web.

# NeoLoad in Jenkins

There is [an extensive on-demand workshop series](https://www.neotys.com/neoload-jenkins-workshop-series)
 on implementing NeoLoad in Jenkins already recorded for your own self-paced learning experience.

# NeoLoad in Azure DevOps

Example Azure DevOps Pipeline using the NeoLoad CLI is [here](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/azure_devops).

# NeoLoad in Gitlab

Example Gitlab pipeline using the NeoLoad CLI is [here](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/gitlab).

# NeoLoad in AWS CodeBuild

Example pipeline using the NeoLoad CLI is [here](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/aws).

# NeoLoad in Bamboo

Example pipeline using the NeoLoad CLI is [here](https://github.com/Neotys-Labs/neoload-cli/tree/master/examples/pipelines/bamboo-specs). Legacy plugin model is deprecated, but still available [here](https://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/#11341.htm).

# NeoLoad in TeamCity (deprecated)

As there are very few requests for running load tests using TeamCity these days, [the legacy
 plugin model](https://www.neotys.com/documents/doc/neoload/latest/#24682.htm) still exists but is no longer actively maintained.
