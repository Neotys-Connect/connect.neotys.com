# What is Neotys Connect?

Neotys Connect is a portal for sharing tutorials, projects, and other useful NeoLoad
 resources. Many of these resources come from customers, contractors, and Neotys
 employees who are passionate about performance engineering and testing and want
 to contribute knowledge and experience related to components of the NeoLoad Platform.

# How is Neotys Connect Different than the Documentation?

Neotys documentation sites are a staple of product feature and functionality information.
 There are also some tutorials there, however to encourage contributions from everyone
 and timely turnaround to sharing those resources, we look to a community-driven
 model for driving Neotys Connect content. This website itself is a public Git repository
 hosted by Github Pages, so if there's anything to add or tweak, anyone in the world
 should feel free to fork it, make the change, and then create a pull request (PR) for
 the {% include core-team-link.md %} to approve in a matter of days.

# How is Neotys Connect Different than Neotys Labs?

Similar to Neotys Connect, Neotys Labs is a Github Organization with repos for various
 integrations and project work. However, the work in Neotys Labs is
 *driven by Neotys product and development teams internally*. While you can also fork, change, and PR
 those repos too, it might take a while for your contribution to be published because
 our R&D team has a high degree of quality that work in the Labs must go through.

In contrast to Labs, Neotys Connect repos are community-driven work and not
 *not supported by Neotys* so the level of quality and scrutiny is up to the contributors
 of that project to maintain. The {% include core-team-link.md %} is responsible for creating the
 repo and assigning maintainers to individual repos so that there is some level
 of control over who can do what, but it's more relaxed than Neotys Labs.

# What is the '{{ site.core_team_text }}' and Who is on it?

The {% include core-team-link.md %} is a trusted set of maintainers and moderators that includes
 Neotys engineers, a few expert partners, and in a few cases Neotys customers.
 Those who have chosen to make their membership to this group public can be seen
 on [the organization's people list](https://github.com/orgs/Neotys-Connect/people).

Separate from the administrators of the Neotys-Connect organization, the Connect
 Core Team is responsible for reviewing and approving community contributions per
 our [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/Neotys-Connect/connect.neotys.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and moderating community activity to comply with our
 Code of Conduct and Terms of Use.

# Are there Guidelines for Contributing?

Yes! There  are general [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/Neotys-Connect/connect.neotys.com/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), and a [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service)
 that you should familiarize yourself with.

There are also [tutorials for how to get started](/contribute/start), depending on your project type.

# What if I can't find what I'm looking for?

This site is constantly evolving based on community contributions, but does not
 contain 100% of all product documentation or external resources. If you find
 useful information that you think should be represented on in this portal,
 please contact the {% include core-team-link.md %} about it.
